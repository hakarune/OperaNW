						About Opera Quest Northwest
					</h2>
					<p>
						Opera Quest Northwest is a newly incorporated nonprofit, and the designated successor to the Vancouver Children’s Opera.  We are building and expanding on that organization’s 12-year heritage of presenting live opera to young audiences.  
					</p>
					<p>
						Our mission is “to educate, enrich and instill a love of music in the children of our region by introducing them to opera through a lively production that blends classic opera excerpts with a humorous, interactive script.”  
					</p>
					<p>
						With the help of grants and private donations, we offer our production “Opera the Great” to elementary schools at no cost to the school. “Opera the Great” is a live program featuring five young professional singers and a pianist.  
					</p>
					<p>
						Over the past three years, we have presented it throughout Vancouver’s Evergreen School District to the delight of hundreds of 3rd through 5th graders.  At the end of the show, the children are able to ask any opera-related questions they may have.
					</p>
					<p>
						An Orchards Elementary teacher was impressed with the production. “It really awakened my students’ appreciation for classical music performance.  Besides this, it’s funny, witty and engaging.  My students talked about it for weeks afterward, and even acted out their favorite parts,” the teacher said.  
					</p>
					<p>
						Educating young people is the whole purpose of “Opera the Great.”  We believe passionately in the power of music in education; and in fact, studies confirm that participating in music activities helps children excel academically.  Supplementary programs like ours are especially vital in a time when many schools are reducing or even eliminating funding for music and the arts.  
					</p>
					<p>
						Don Nelson, fine arts manager for Evergreen Public Schools, agrees on the impact “Opera the Great” has on these students, “After three years of having ‘Opera the Great’ in our schools, I can say that every principal consistently tells me this is one of the most engaging and delightful assemblies they have hosted,” Nelson said.
					</p>
					<p>
						Music enriches the soul of a community, yet many families do not have the resources to expose their children to live classical music.  That’s where we come in; by bringing it into our schools, we are planting the seeds for a lifelong appreciation of—and support for—the performing arts that will benefit current and future generations.  
					</p>
					<p>
						Our performers are all educators by nature, training and profession.  Our program has specific educational goals:  for example, students learn opera vocabulary, history, characters, voice parts and famous melodies.  Since children learn best through participation, our script lets them try out operatic gestures and singing styles and become part of the chorus. Some even have the chance to come onstage as opera characters.
